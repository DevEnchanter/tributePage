        <li><strong>11 May 1014:</strong> Birth of Anawrahta Minsaw.</li>
        <li><strong>1044:</strong> Anawrahta raises a rebellion against Sokkate, the current ruler, challenging him to single combat. On August 11, he successfully slew Sokkate at Myinkaba, near Pagan</li>
        <li><strong>16 December 1044:</strong> After refusing to take up the throne initially, Anawrahta ascends to the throne and adopts the title of Anawrahta, marking the beginning of historically verifiable Burmese history​</li>
        <li><strong>1044 and onward:</strong>Anawrahta unifies the entire Irrawaddy valley for the first time in history and successfully stops the advance of the Khmer Empire into Tenasserim coastline and into Upper Menam valley, making Pagan one of two main kingdoms in mainland Southeast Asia​</li>
        <li><strong>1057:</strong> Anawrahta captures the Mon city of Thaton, leading other Mon rulers to submit to him and marking the first time a Burmese ruler dominated the Irrawaddy River delta​.</li>
        <li><strong>1058:</strong> The earliest extant Burmese inscription, written in Mon characters, appears, reflecting the enrichment of Burmese civilization through contact with the Mons.</li>
        <li><strong>During his reign:</strong> Anawrahta implements a series of key social, religious, and economic reforms that shape modern-day Burmese culture. He builds a series of weirs that turn the parched, arid regions around Pagan into the main rice granaries of Upper Burma​.</li>
        <li><strong>During his reign:</strong> Anawrahta is converted to Theravāda Buddhism by a Mon monk, Shin Arahan. He strives to convert his people from the influence of the Ari, a Mahāyāna Tantric Buddhist sect, making Theravāda Buddhism the dominant religion of Myanmar​.</li>
        <li><strong>1071:</strong> King Vijayabāhu of Ceylon requests the assistance of Burmese monks to help revive the Buddhist faith. In response, the Ceylonese king sends Anawrahta a replica of the Buddha’s tooth relic, which is placed in the Shwezigon pagoda at Pagan.</li>
